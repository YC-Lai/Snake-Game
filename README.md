# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game

This Snake Game is based on stater [repo](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game) for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The current project improve the original classes, and add some new features such as:

- Put `controller`, `game`, `renderer` in different thread;
- Add obstacle class, which can move in a random direction;
- Re-organize the Class Structure.

| &#9745; | The project uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers.                                  | The project uses at least one smart pointer: `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, or `weak_ptr`.
